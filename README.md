## A little about me.
I have been working as a developer since 2009. It’s a long time..<br /><br />

I have ever programmed in Python, PHP (Zend Framework, Codeigniter, Cake Php), .Net, .Net Core and a little bit Java. <br />
I have never programmed in React.js before this challenge. I liked a lot to learn about it. I hope to be a part of the Rock Content team, but I want to thank you for the opportunity to learn it - I expend the last 4 days in it.<br />
Although my 11 years programming, I have never started a project in .Net from its beginning. Then I have some considerations:

## Security:
For the security, I would configure STS in the .Net API.

## Scalability:
For the scalability, I would consider to use Lambda AWS for the PUT method of .Net API.

## But at first:
But, at first off all, I would consult another developers in Rock Content to know the best practices adopted by the Company. I really believe in the exchange of knowledge. 

## Finaly
I hope to have the opportunity to grow up whit Rock Content team. 

## Thanks for today.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
